# DnD_Treasure_Rolling_Simulator
A program designed to faithfully reproduce generation of treasure via random dice rolls using the SRD of Dungeons and Dragons v3.5

Goal: Basically to build a tool to automatically generate loot using the Dungeons and Dragons v3.5 System Reference Documents (SRD) provided online as though players had rolled all the dice accordingly.

Purpose: Having a small tool like this should help streamline potentially tedious aspects of Dungeons and Dragons, so that both players and the Dungeon Master (DM) can quickly move forward with other aspects of the game. Additionally, this tool should be generalizable enough for the DM to insert more "homebrew" loot without making any large changes to the system itself.

Constraints Present: This project was created with the idea being that only the C programming language can be used, as an exercise in both program design and execution.
